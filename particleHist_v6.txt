---- Modify Hist_v5 and organize source files in packages ----

***
Create 4 directories
- AnalysisFramework
- AnalysisUtilities
- AnalysisObjects
- AnalysisPlugins

***
Move all the source files to those directories:
- to AnalysisFramework:
  main.cc
  AnalysisInfo.h,cc
  Event.h,cc
  EventSource.h,cc
  EventReadFromFile.h,cc
  EventSim.h,cc
  SourceFactory.h,cc
  AnalysisSteering.h,cc
  AnalysisFactory.h,cc
- to AnalysisUtilities:
  Constants.h,cc
  Utilities.h,cc
  QuadraticFitter.h,cc
- to AnalysisObjects:
  ParticleReco.h,cc
  ProperTime.h,cc
  MassMean.h,cc
  LifetimeFit.h,cc
- to AnalysisPlugins:
  EventDump.h,cc
  ParticleMass.h,cc
  ParticleLifetime.h,cc

***
Update the paths in all the #include instructions

***
Compile the code in AnalysisFramework, AnalysisUtilities, AnalysisObjects
and produce a dynamic library for each package.
Modify the "braggPlot_v6/compile" script changing the names where needed.

***
Compile the code in AnalysisPlugins and produce a dynamic library for 
each class.

***
Create a dummy source file and compile it linking the libraries, 
to produce different executables (as in braggPlot_v6)

***
Remember to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the path where
the libraries are stored: for ROOT that's done with the script
source ...../root..../bin/thisroot.[sh,csh]
for the libraries produced fron this code, use the command
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}":."
or
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}":."
according to your command shell, sh or csh ; you can discover with the command
echo $0
anyway you can try both export... and setenv... and only one will work and the
other one will give an error message but will not be harmful
